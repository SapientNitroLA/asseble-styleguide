1. Configuration Structure: done
	- Set up a structure that the developer needs to follow when setting up the project

2. Parse Input
	- Find means to parse the data from our CSS, JS and HTML files
	- Implement these parsers to get the data (ex. pull in comments from JS files)

3. Structure Data
	- Gather all of our input data into one place so that it can easily be digested by the tool. This would include not only the parsed input, but also extraneous info from various readme files the developer created.

4. Output Data
	- Use Assemble to digest the data for final, readable outputs which we would then use to create:
